# HYBRID-PHOTONIC-ELECTRONIC-AI
Hybrid Photonic-Electronic AI is a frontier field in computing that aims to overcome the fundamental limitations of traditional electronic processors (like CPUs and GPUs) by using light (photons) for the most computationally intensive tasks, while still relying on mature electronics for control, memory, and non-linear operations.
